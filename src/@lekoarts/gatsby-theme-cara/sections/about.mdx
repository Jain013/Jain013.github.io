> Are aisi angrezi ave hain ke I can leave angrez behind (I know such English that I will leave the British behind). You see sir, I can talk English, I can walk English, I can laugh English, I can run English, because English is such a funny language. Bhairo becomes Byron because their minds are very narrow.
